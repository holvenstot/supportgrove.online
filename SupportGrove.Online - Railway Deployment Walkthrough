3. **Repository Selection**: Choose your SupportGrove repository
4. **Service Configuration**: Railway will ask what to deploy

### Step 6: Configure Backend Service

**Important Configuration Steps:**

1. **Root Directory**: Set to `supportgrove-backend`
   - This tells Railway to look in the backend folder
   - Railway will automatically detect it's a Python project

2. **Service Name**: Name it `supportgrove-backend`
   - This helps identify the service in your dashboard
   - Use descriptive names for easier management

3. **Auto-Detection**: Railway will automatically:
   - Detect Python from `requirements.txt`
   - Use the `railway.toml` configuration I created
   - Set up the build and start commands

### Step 7: Set Environment Variables

Railway needs these environment variables for production:

**Required Variables:**
```
FLASK_ENV=production
SECRET_KEY=[Generate a secure random string]
PORT=5000
```

**How to Set Variables:**
1. Go to your service dashboard
2. Click "Variables" tab
3. Add each variable:
   - Click "New Variable"
   - Enter name and value
   - Click "Add"

**Generating SECRET_KEY:**
Use a secure random string generator or run:
```python
import secrets
print(secrets.token_hex(32))
```

### Step 8: Deploy Backend

1. **Trigger Deployment**: Railway automatically deploys when you push to GitHub
2. **Monitor Progress**: Watch the build logs in real-time
3. **Deployment Success**: You'll see a green checkmark when complete
4. **Get URL**: Railway provides a URL like `https://supportgrove-backend-production.up.railway.app`

### Step 9: Create Frontend Service

**Option A: Same Project (Recommended)**
1. In your existing project, click "New Service"
2. Select "GitHub Repo" and choose the same repository
3. Set root directory to `supportgrove-frontend`

**Option B: Separate Project**
1. Create entirely new project for frontend
2. Follow same GitHub connection process
3. Better for separate management

### Step 10: Configure Frontend Service

**Frontend Configuration:**
1. **Service Name**: `supportgrove-frontend`
2. **Root Directory**: `supportgrove-frontend`
3. **Framework Detection**: Railway auto-detects React/Vite
4. **Build Command**: `npm install && npm run build`
5. **Start Command**: Railway handles static file serving automatically

### Step 11: Set Frontend Environment Variables

**Critical Frontend Variable:**
```
VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-backend-url.up.railway.app/api
```

**How to Get Backend URL:**
1. Go to your backend service
2. Copy the Railway-provided URL
3. Add `/api` to the end
4. Use this as your `VITE_API_BASE_URL`

**Example:**
If your backend URL is `https://supportgrove-backend-production.up.railway.app`
Then set: `VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://supportgrove-backend-production.up.railway.app/api`

### Step 12: Deploy Frontend

1. **Automatic Build**: Railway builds your React app
2. **Static File Serving**: Railway serves the built files
3. **CDN Distribution**: Your frontend is distributed globally
4. **SSL Included**: HTTPS is automatically enabled

**Expected Frontend Build:**
```
âœ… Detecting Node.js project
âœ… Installing npm dependencies
âœ… Running npm run build
âœ… Optimizing static assets
âœ… Deploying to CDN
âœ… Frontend live and accessible
```

## Phase 5: Custom Domain Configuration

### Step 13: Add Custom Domain to Frontend

1. **Go to Frontend Service**: Navigate to your frontend service dashboard
2. **Settings Tab**: Click on "Settings"
3. **Domains Section**: Find the "Custom Domains" section
4. **Add Domain**: Click "Add Domain"
5. **Enter Domain**: Add both:
   - `supportgrove.online`
   - `www.supportgrove.online`

### Step 14: Configure DNS Records

Railway will provide specific DNS instructions. Typically:

**For Root Domain (supportgrove.online):**
```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: [Railway's IP address]
